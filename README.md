# Netflix Clone with TMDb API

Welcome to the Netflix Clone project! This application aims to replicate the user experience of the popular streaming service Netflix by leveraging the power of the TMDb (The Movie Database) API. With this app, users can explore a vast catalog of movies and TV shows, watch trailers, read detailed information about their favorite content, and even create personalized watchlists.

# Project Overview

In a world where streaming services have become an integral part of our entertainment routine, this project provides a unique opportunity to build a Netflix-inspired platform that can be customized and extended as per your needs. By utilizing the TMDb API, we gain access to a wealth of movie and TV show data, including posters, cast and crew information, release dates, and more.
